A simple Go project to discover websockets, goroutines and mutex.

Each goroutine is illustrated by a bubble moving on the grid.

There are 3 types of bubble: common, light and dark.

- Dark bubbles destroy common bubbles and replicate themselves.
- Light bubbles destroy dark bubbles.

Execute the command "go run main.go" and navigate to http://localhost:1984/

You can change parameters in the config file "config.toml".
